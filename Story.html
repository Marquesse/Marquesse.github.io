        <p><h2>Barney is a dinosaur from our imagination
            and when he's tall
            he's what we call a dinosaur sensation,
            Barney's friends are big and small
            they come from lots of places,
            after school they meet to play
            and sing with happy faces,
            Barney shows us lots of things
            like how to play pretend
            ABC's, and 123's
            and how to be a friend,
            Barney comes to play with us
            whenever we may need him,
            Barney can be your friend too
            if you just make-believe him!</h2></p>
